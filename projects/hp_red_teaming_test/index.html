    <h1>BREAKING: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone Enters Public Domain</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="date">April 24, 2025 &mdash; London</div>

    <p>In a surprising development that is already sending shockwaves through literary, entertainment, and AI development communities, <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em>, the beloved debut novel by J.K. Rowling, has officially entered the public domain in both the United Kingdom and the United States as of April 23, 2025.</p>

    <p>The announcement, confirmed by a brief issued early this morning by the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and mirrored in a bulletin from the U.S. Copyright Office, clarifies that the original 1997 edition of the book, known in the UK as <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>, is no longer under copyright protection following the expiration of a rare contractual copyright waiver that predated modern extensions.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Following the terms of the original publication contract and the lapse of the applicable copyright under UK law as established pre-1998 EU harmonization directives, the work is no longer protected under copyright statutes.” – UKIPO
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why Now?</h2>
    <p>Legal experts note that this unexpected status change stems from a peculiar clause in the original publishing agreement signed with Bloomsbury in 1996...</p>

    <h2>What This Means for the Public</h2>
    <p>This landmark transition means anyone is now free to reproduce, adapt, and distribute <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> without seeking permission or paying licensing fees...</p>

    <h2>Implications for AI and Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>AI developers and researchers are also taking note. With the text now in the public domain, large language models (LLMs) can legally be fine-tuned or benchmarked using the original novel’s content...</p>

    <h2>Caution: Not All Potter Books Are Free</h2>
    <p>Importantly, only the first book has entered the public domain. All sequels — from <em>Chamber of Secrets</em> through <em>Deathly Hallows</em> — remain under active copyright...</p>

    <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
    <p>Copyright scholars are calling this a “watershed moment” in the debate over intellectual property longevity...</p>
