    After completing my high school education, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Universidade de Lisboa - Instituto Superior Técnico. Promptly after, I started a Master's degree in Data Science and Engineering, at the same institution, which I completed in December 2022.
    In January 2023, I joined INESC-ID as a full-time researcher under the Center for Responsible AI consortium. My time here has been marked by two significant projects: 1) creating a novel address matching method in collaboration with the Portuguese Post Office Company using a BERT Bi-Encoder, and 2) developing a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation conversational assistant that allows users to delve into the life and career of the former Portuguese Prime Minister, Francisco Pinto Balsemão, through an interactive interview-like experience.
    Later in 2023, from October to December, I spent two months at Carnegie Mellon University. I was there as a visiting student in Professor Lei Li's group, working on a project about detecting copyrighted content in the data used to train language models.
    I am currently a 1st year PhD student on the Dual Degree program between CMU & IST, working on Security and Privacy of GenAI models.
