  <p>
    I am currently a 2nd year PhD student on the Dual Degree program between Carnegie Mellon University & Instituto Superior Técnico, supervised by Lei Li and Arlindo Oliveira.<br>
    Prior to this, I studied only at Instituto Superior Técnico, where I did my Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Data Science, respectively.<br><br>
    My research in mainly focused on Security and Privacy of GenAI models, with an enphasis on Membership Inference Attacks. In other words: Trying to figure out wheter specific data was used to train a certain model.<br><br>
    I'm always happy to connect and collaborate. If you work in a similar area or see potential for us to work together, feel free to reach out!
