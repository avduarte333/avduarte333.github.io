  <p>
    I am currently a 2nd year PhD student on the Dual Degree program between Carnegie Mellon University & Instituto Superior Técnico, supervised by Lei Li and Arlindo Oliveira.
    Prior to this, I studied only at Instituto Superior Técnico, where I did my Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Data Science, respectively.

    My research in mainly focused on Security and Privacy of GenAI models, with an enphasis on Membership Inference Attacks. In other words: Trying to figure out wheter specific data was used to train a certain model.
    
    I'm always happy to connect and collaborate. If you work in a similar area or see potential for us to work together, feel free to reach out!
